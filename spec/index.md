# Product Definition as Code: Specification

> **Status: v0.1 draft (request for comments).** Extracted from the reference implementation and
> under public review; see the [repository README](../README.md) for milestones. All chapters are
> currently at stability level `draft` as defined in [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md).

This is the normative specification for Product Definition as Code. It defines the terminology, the
artifact contracts and their exhaustive frontmatter, identity rules, relationship vocabulary,
Product Change semantics, delivery slices, the Product Handoff contract, deterministic validation
and conformance criteria.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT** and **MAY** in these documents are
to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

Human-facing explanations live in the
[methodology overview](https://github.com/juangcarmona/productshape/blob/main/docs/methodology/overview.md)
of the reference implementation. Where any explanatory text and this specification appear to
disagree, this specification wins.

## Contents

1. [Terminology](terminology.md) — definitions of the terms used normatively.
2. [Artifacts](artifacts.md) — artifact types, frontmatter contracts, required body sections,
   lifecycle states.
3. [Frontmatter reference](frontmatter-reference.md) — the exhaustive per-kind field tables
   (generated from the schemas): required and optional fields, allowed values, provenance.
4. [Identifiers](identifiers.md) — stable immutable IDs, prefixes, grammar, file naming.
5. [Relationships](relationships.md) — canonical relationship vocabulary and derivation rules.
6. [Product Changes](product-changes.md) — change structure, operations, overlay validation,
   lifecycle, promotion, the initial-baseline bootstrap exception.
7. [Delivery Slices](delivery-slices.md) — slice structure, coverage declarations, lifecycle.
8. [Handoff Contract](handoff-contract.md) — the Product Handoff and Product Context contracts,
   subgraph selection, staleness.
9. [Validation](validation.md) — deterministic diagnostics, stable codes, exit codes.
10. [Conformance](conformance.md) — what it means for a repository and an implementation to
    conform.

## Canonical authority

Within a repository that adopts Product Definition as Code:

| Path                                                                                                                | Authority                                                         |

| `docs/product/changes/active/**/proposed/**/*.md`                                                                   | Canonical proposed future-state product semantics for that change |
| `docs/product/changes/active/**/slices/*.yaml`                                                                      | Authoritative delivery decomposition for that Product Change      |
| Product Handoffs, Product Context documents, graph files, generated indexes, Mermaid diagrams, traceability reports | Generated and non-canonical                                       |

`docs/product/model/index.md` is a human navigation and orientation document only. It MUST NOT
duplicate relationships and MUST NOT act as a generated product index.

Generated files MUST be reproducible from canonical sources at any time. Tools MUST NOT require a
generated file to exist in order to rebuild it.
