# Frontmatter reference

The exhaustive field contract of every document kind: which properties are allowed, which are
required, and what values they accept.

[Artifacts](artifacts.md) defines what each artifact type _means_ and why it exists; this chapter
defines the _fields_. Where the two appear to disagree, the JSON Schemas under `schemas/` win — the
tables below are generated from them (`pnpm docs:frontmatter`) and a conformance test fails the
build if they drift.

Every kind is a **closed** object: an unknown property is a `PRODUCT002` error, not a warning and
not silently ignored. There is no extension point. If you need to record something the schema does
not allow, put it in the Markdown body.

Conforming implementations SHOULD expose this contract programmatically (for example as a schema query command), so it can be inspected without a repository.

## How to read the tables

| Column         | Meaning                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field          | The YAML key. `a.b` is a nested key; `a[]` is an array element, and `a[].b` a key of an element object. |
| Required       | Whether the key must be present. For a nested key, whether it is required _when its parent is present_. |
| Type           | `string`, `const` (one permitted value), `enum`, `array`, `object`.                                     |
| Allowed values | The permitted values, or the regular expression a string must match.                                    |
| Notes          | Constraints and guidance carried by the schema itself.                                                  |

Four fields are common to every Markdown-authored kind: `id` (stable and immutable, see
[Identifiers](identifiers.md)), `type`, `title` and `status`. Artifact `status` is
`draft | active | deprecated | retired`; Product Changes and Delivery Slices have their own
lifecycles.

## Provenance

`provenance` is an optional object accepted by all nine artifact kinds. It records the **evidence**
behind recovered knowledge: where a claim came from and how strongly the evidence supports it.

Set it on recovered (brownfield) artifacts. Leave it unset on greenfield artifacts authored from
intent — there is no evidence to cite, and an empty claim of provenance is worse than none.

Provenance is deliberately _not_ authorship metadata. [Artifacts](artifacts.md) forbids author,
owner, date, version and review fields because Git history already records who changed what and
when. Provenance answers a different question: how far to trust this artifact's content.

A `draft` artifact whose `provenance.confidence` is `low` produces a `PRODUCT111` warning, so the
queue of candidates needing human validation is derivable from validation output rather
than tracked by hand.

| Field            | Required | Allowed values                                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `source`         | yes      | free text                                                | A file path, a URL, a ticket reference, or `interview: <person>`.                                                                                                        |
| `confidence`     | yes      | `high`, `medium`, `low`                                  | `high`: read directly from a specification scenario or a test. `medium`: inferred from structured prose. `low`: inferred from indirect evidence such as a variable name. |
| `recovered-from` | no       | `observation`, `inference`, `interview`, `documentation` | How the knowledge was recovered. Optional, because real evidence is often more than one of these.                                                                        |

```yaml
provenance:
  source: src/orders/validation.ts (limit check), tests/orders/limits.spec.ts
  confidence: high
  recovered-from: observation
```

`provenance` itself is closed: an unrecognised sub-field such as `recovered-by` is a `PRODUCT002`
error, and omitting `confidence` while providing `source` is too.

## Artifact frontmatter

The nine artifact types of the current product model.

### Actor

`ACT-`. Who or what interacts with the product to achieve a meaningful outcome. See
[Artifacts → Actor](artifacts.md#actor-actor-act-).

`BC-`. A product-language boundary. Note the absence of `owns-terms`: term ownership is derived
from `Domain Term.defined-in` and MUST NOT be authored here (see

### Functional Requirement

`FR-`. A derived product obligation stating what the product must do. `derived-from` is what keeps
it traceable to the knowledge it came from. See

### Constraint

`CON-`. An externally imposed or deliberately fixed boundary. When `applies-to` is absent the
constraint applies to the entire product. See

## Retired frontmatter

The Product Change (`CHG-`), Delivery Slice (`SLI-`), Product Handoff (`HOF-`) and Product Coverage
frontmatter kinds are retired (RFC #4). Their schemas and field tables have been removed; their
prefixes are never reused (see [Identifiers](identifiers.md)). Consumer documents cite canonical
product text through the [Citation Contract](handoff-contract.md) instead.
