# Validation

Structural validation is deterministic. Given the same repository content, validation MUST produce
the same diagnostics in the same order on every platform. AI is never used to enforce structural
invariants.

## Diagnostics

Every diagnostic carries:

| Field      | Presence        | Meaning                                            |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `severity` | always          | `error` or `warning`                               |
| `code`     | always          | stable code from the tables below                  |
| `message`  | always          | human-readable explanation                         |
| `file`     | always          | repository-relative source file (POSIX separators) |
| `artifact` | when available  | artifact ID                                        |
| `field`    | when available  | frontmatter field or relationship                  |
| `target`   | when applicable | referenced target ID                               |

Diagnostics MUST be available in machine-readable JSON (`--format json`) and MUST be ordered
deterministically (by file, then code, then target).

Warnings are not errors. `validation.warnings-as-errors` in `.product/config.yaml` MAY escalate
them for a repository; tools MUST NOT escalate unilaterally.

validation does not inspect managed files.

`PRODUCT101` is mechanically resolvable: an implementation MAY offer a fix operation renaming each file to
`<id.toLowerCase()>.md`. It renames through a temporary name so it also works on case-insensitive
filesystems, where a casing-only rename is otherwise a silent no-op. `--dry-run` reports the plan and
exits non-zero when anything would change, which makes it usable as a CI gate: `PRODUCT101` is a
warning, so it is not otherwise caught unless `warnings-as-errors` is set.

`PRODUCT111` marks recovered knowledge that needs human validation rather than a defect to repair;

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

## Digests

Content digests are SHA-256 over the artifact's UTF-8 bytes with CRLF and CR line endings
normalized to LF, rendered as `sha256:<lowercase hex>`. This normalization is mandatory: digests
MUST be identical across operating systems and Git line-ending configurations.

## Determinism requirements

- Artifact discovery, graph compilation, traversal, impact analysis and diagnostic ordering MUST
  be deterministic and platform-independent.
- Generated outputs (`product-graph.json`, indexes, Mermaid, diagnostics JSON) MUST be
  byte-identical for identical input content, and `product-graph.json` MUST carry a versioned
  schema identifier.
